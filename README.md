# DATE:
# INVERSE-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the inverse of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
Step1 :
Import Numpy

Step 2:
Define the matrix for which you want to find the inverse

Step 3:
use the numpy.linalg.inv() function to find the inverse of the matrix

Step 4:
Display the result
